# Avatar The Last Airbender The Game!
Avatar the last airbender, the game. A basic game where you get to paly the role of whatever avatar you choose. You go through their life experience, fight their enemies and bring peace to the villages.

## Technologies Used:
I used HTML to structure my page, CSS style my page, and JavaScript to add dynamic feel and user interaction.

## Link To the game and how to play it:
GitHub: https://nairobisheikh.github.io/AvatarTheLastAirbender/
Netlify: https://sharp-kare-2e3ca3.netlify.app/
Since I decided not to complete the other characters the only choice you have is Toph, so when you choose a character youll only be play Toph, then make your way to Toph live and play the game, win the game, and save the world,,,, is that easy.

## Future enhancements:
What I plan on doing is adding three more games with in the remaining characters So they can be playable to.

## Sources used:
Above the Avatar title slide, the characters can be translated to:
降卋神通 - the spiritual medium who has descended upon the world (i.e. the Avatar).
